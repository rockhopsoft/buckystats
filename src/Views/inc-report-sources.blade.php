<p>
    Used for 2015-2020 weekly data, but only for 2017-2020 annual data.<br />
    National Center for Health Statistics. Weekly counts of deaths by jurisdiction and age group.<br />

    <p>
        "Both unweighted and weighted (predicted) provisional counts are provided.
        Weighting of provisional counts is done to account for potential underreporting
        in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still
        likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days
        of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction and age.
        The completeness of provisional data varies by cause of death and by age group.
        However, the weights applied do not account for this variability. Therefore,
        the predicted numbers of deaths may be too low for some age groups and causes of death.
        For example, provisional data on deaths among younger age groups is typically
        less complete than among older age groups. Predicted counts may therefore
        be too low among the younger age groups. More detail about the methods,
        weighting, data, and limitations can be found in the Technical Notes."

        The estimated mortality rate per hundred thousand was
        used here to calculate the death counts in these years.
        The rates appeared to make more sense and were closer to
        the same ballpark as the older numbers I found for Maryland.

        "Many of the crude rates have been revised from the original publication to
        reflect the modification of population data after a later census was conducted."

    "Historical Debt Outstanding is a dataset that provides a summary
    of the U.S. government's total outstanding debt at the end of each
    fiscal year from 1789 to the current year. Between 1789 and 1842,
    the fiscal year began in January. From January 1842 until 1977,
    the fiscal year began in July. From July 1977 onwards, the fiscal year
    has started in October. Between 1789 and 1919, debt outstanding was
    presented as of the first day of the next fiscal year. From 1920 onwards,
    debt outstanding has been presented as of the final day of the fiscal year.
    This is a high-level summary of historical public debt and
    does not contain a breakdown of the debt components."
