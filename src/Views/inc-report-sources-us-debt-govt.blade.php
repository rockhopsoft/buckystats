"Historical Debt Outstanding is a dataset that provides a summary
of the U.S. government's total outstanding debt at the end of each
fiscal year from 1789 to the current year. Between 1789 and 1842,
the fiscal year began in January. From January 1842 until 1977,
the fiscal year began in July. From July 1977 onwards, the fiscal year
has started in October. Between 1789 and 1919, debt outstanding was
presented as of the first day of the next fiscal year. From 1920 onwards,
debt outstanding has been presented as of the final day of the fiscal year.
This is a high-level summary of historical public debt and
does not contain a breakdown of the debt components."
