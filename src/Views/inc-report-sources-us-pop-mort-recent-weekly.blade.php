    "Both unweighted and weighted (predicted) provisional counts are provided.
    Weighting of provisional counts is done to account for potential underreporting
    in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still
    likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days
    of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction and age.
    The completeness of provisional data varies by cause of death and by age group.
    However, the weights applied do not account for this variability. Therefore,
    the predicted numbers of deaths may be too low for some age groups and causes of death.
    For example, provisional data on deaths among younger age groups is typically
    less complete than among older age groups. Predicted counts may therefore
    be too low among the younger age groups. More detail about the methods,
    weighting, data, and limitations can be found in the Technical Notes."
